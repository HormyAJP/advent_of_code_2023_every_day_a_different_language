    Given a sequence {a_n} which "stabilizes" after n steps, the next value in the sequence is given
    by:

    a_(k+1) = (n choose 1) * a_k - (n choose 2) * a_(k-1) + (n choose 3) * a_(k-2) - ...
                    + (-1)^n * (n choose n) * a_(k-n)

    By "stablize" we mean the number of steps before the differences of a sequence become zero.

    e.g. If a sequence stabilises after 1 step then a_(k+1) = 2 * a_k - a_(k-1)
    e.g. If a sequence stabilises after 2 steps then a_(k+1) = 3 * a_k - 3 * a_(k-1) + a_(k-2)
